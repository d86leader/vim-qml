# QML syntax file for VIM

The actual syntax highlight file was done by Warwick Allison.

Modified by d86leader to have any curly braces be a folding syntax item.

## How to use
I strongly suggest you use the excellent [pathogen tool](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) from Tim Pope and clone this repos or add it as a submodule under your bundle directory.
